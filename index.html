  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children.” — Proverbs 13:22
  </blockquote>
  <p>Grandpa’s inheritance is never merely material. It was a wealth of discipline, vision, and unshakable faith in the value of education, humility and hard work. He taught us that legacy isn’t something left behind—it’s something sown deep, growing with each life it touches.</p>
  <p>He is not just a man of stature, but of stories. Even now, he reminds us that discipline is a seed, and education the rain. I became a teacher because his lessons planted themselves in me. I further my education now as a way of ensuring his love for education is fulfilled through me—and that I live to become the best version of myself, like he did. He surely lived to become his best!</p>
  <p>I always believe that his eyes are the lens through which I see myself—and now, I return the gift through this book.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">📖 Foreword</h3>
  <p>I write these words not just as his grandchild, but as a grateful recipient of a life steeped in integrity and purpose. Babu—our respected senior chief—has always championed education and development, and his efforts carved paths where none seemed possible. Even in his later years, he continues to speak for the future: children, learning, and character.</p>
  <p>This story is told in his own voice, using the first person “I,” because I wanted readers to feel what I’ve always felt—his presence, his rhythm, his truth. Every page is my effort to hold up a mirror to the man who played a great role in raising me, so his reflections may never fade.</p>
  <p>May this book honor him while he can still hold it in his hands. And may his story nourish others, as it nourished me.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">✍️ Author's Reflection – Boniface  Kaiser</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “The memory of the righteous is a blessing.” — Proverbs 10:7
  </blockquote>

  <p>I speak not only as a grandchild, but as a witness to legacy in motion. Babu’s life was more than a story — it was a sermon in action. He lived as a shepherd of his people, a teacher to his family, and a builder of futures. He showed us that the quiet power of integrity outlasts any title or wealth.</p>

  <p>His legacy shaped how I view manhood, leadership, and service. Every visit to his homestead was a reminder of who we are and where we come from. In his discipline, I found strength. In his prayers, I found peace. In his footsteps, I saw the path I, too, must walk — humbly, courageously, and faithfully.</p>

  <p>I reflect on him not as history but as heritage. And through these pages, I hope others see what we saw — a man who gave all of himself so that others could rise. This tribute is my way of saying: I remember. I honor. I continue.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">📖 Foreword</h3>
  <p>As I helped document this incredible journey, I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of what Babu has achieved — not just in office, but in the hearts of those he served. His voice in this biography is strong, personal, and direct. That’s how he lived: never distant, never indifferent.</p>

  <p>I chose to retain his first-person narration because I want readers to hear him — the man who stood tall not just in stature but in wisdom and faith. Through this story, may his life continue to instruct, to inspire, and to ignite hope in generations yet to come.</p>

  <p>We write, not because he is gone — but because he is still here. Still teaching. Still guiding. Still blessing.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">🧒 Chapter One: Early Life</h3>

  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “From the humblest paths trodden barefoot to the firm ground of destiny, greatness often begins in the quiet belief that life holds more.
    Chief Nyanaro’s early journey teaches us that dreams shaped by struggle, faith, and perseverance can rise from even the most modest beginnings.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Jeremiah 29:11</em> — “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, 
  plans to give you a hope and a future.”</p>

  <p>Have you ever dreamt of flying? Of reaching a goal so far beyond your current circumstances that it felt impossible? Chief James Nyanaro once did. 
  And he believed. That belief would carry him far — beyond the fields of his childhood to the leadership of an entire region.</p>

  <p>Born around <em>1936</em>, in a time when calendars and clocks held little meaning in rural Kisii, his parents — <em>Nyabaro Momanyi Nyaweri</em> 
  and <em>Yusabia Kemunto</em>, daughter of Mbee of the Bonyakoni clan — marked his arrival not by date, but by memory. His mother lovingly recalled 
  that on the day he was born, a strange darkness fell across the land. It was also the day the first motor vehicle, affectionately dubbed <em>"Bota"</em>, passed 
  through their village. That mysterious dimming of the sun? It was, as he later discovered, a solar eclipse — <em>‘Enyakoira’</em> in Ekegusii.</p>

  <p>Years later, through historical research and his passion for memory, he identified his true birthday as <em>13th December 1936</em>. 
  However, official records such as his <em>national ID</em> listed his date of birth as <em>1st January 1941</em> — a placeholder date 
  commonly used for many in that generation before formal registrations were widespread. While the government may say one thing, 
  <em>his heart held firm to his mother’s memory and the signs of the sky</em>.</p>

  <p>Childhood was a time of wonder and quiet growth. With no shoes to wear and no modern clothes, children wrapped themselves in shukas, 
  held together with safety pins. It was a simple life, but every task, every game, and every challenge planted the seeds of resilience and identity.</p>

  <p>At age twelve, he underwent the traditional <em>circumcision ceremony</em> — the rite of passage into manhood. 
  Remarkably, another eclipse occurred on that very day in <em>1948</em>. He saw it not as coincidence, but as a divine confirmation — 
  that his life was uniquely marked. As darkness turned to light, so began his journey into adulthood.</p>

  <p>Determined to support his family and earn a living, young James ventured to the <em>Sotik Highlands</em> in search of work. 
  He found employment on vast farms owned by European settlers, earning a modest wage of five shillings and half a blanket per month. 
  His dedication stood out. He received a raise, and soon became an errand boy for the tractor operators — delivering food each day in the fields. 
  It was during this time that he formed his first deep friendship with <em>Samwel Kabinga</em> of Magwagwa.</p>

  <p>After returning home briefly, he was hired on a cattle ranch called <em>Set Ranch</em>, owned by <em>Magonya</em>. 
  There, his responsibilities included clearing grazing fields, and he earned seven shillings a month. He worked side by side with his friend 
  and agemate <em>Oeba Masanya</em>. By the end of <em>1949</em>, the two returned home for Christmas, carrying not only savings, 
  but the first seeds of a dream planted by experience.</p>

  <p>That dream? A pursuit of something more enduring: <em>education</em>.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">📘 Chapter Two: Education</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “Education is the ladder that lifts one from obscurity to purpose. For Chief Nyanaro, each lesson learned was a step toward transformation — not just for himself, but for a community yet to dream. His journey teaches us that education is never just about books; it's about boldness, persistence, and the belief that knowledge can build nations.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Proverbs 4:7</em> — “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding.”</p>

  <p>In early <em>1950</em>, I sat with my parents and elder brother Ndubi to discuss my dream of going to school. We joined others from our area in seeking formal education. Initially, we enrolled at <em>Gekendo Mission School</em>, a Catholic-founded institution. While my brother Ongaro chose <em>Nyangoge DEB</em> — a district school — we ultimately followed our personal callings, driven by belief: people go for what they want.</p>

  <p>I began in Standard One under teacher <em>Bernado Obiri</em>, and in Standard Two, I was taught by <em>Samwel Ondigi</em>. Eventually, my savings from previous work ran out. To continue learning, I returned with friends to the <em>Sotik Highlands</em> to earn more money. Once we saved enough, we came back — only to find Gekendo had closed.</p>

  <p>But a closed school didn’t mean a closed path. We transferred to <em>Rangenyo School</em>, enrolling in Standard Three as day scholars. Despite the distance and discomfort, I stayed committed. My earlier “eclipse days” felt like divine signs of purpose. I pushed on and reached Standard Four — but illness and registration delays meant I missed my exams. Still, <em>Father Francis More</em> allowed me to continue to Standard Five in <em>1955</em>.</p>

  <p>From there, my momentum built. I passed the <em>CPE (Certificate of Primary Education)</em>, advanced to Standard Six, and eventually completed <em>Standard Seven</em>. In July <em>1959</em>, I passed my <em>Kenya African Primary Education</em> exams.</p>

  <p>Recognizing my performance, the priest at Rangenyo Mission offered me a job as an <em>untrained teacher</em> while I waited for a training opportunity. I worked diligently until <em>December 1960</em>, when I was finally accepted to <em>Asumbi Teachers’ College</em>. From <em>February 1961 to November 1962</em>, I trained and qualified as a <em>P3 teacher</em>.</p>

  <p>In January <em>1963</em>, I was employed and appointed as headteacher at <em>Embonga Primary School</em>. After two years, I transferred to <em>Nyakenyomisia Primary</em> in December <em>1964</em>. There, I met <em>Senior Chief Agustino Moturi</em>, who inspired me to aim higher. I attempted my Form Two exams in <em>1965</em>, but didn’t pass due to my workload. So, I stepped down as headteacher, transferred to <em>Gekendo Primary</em>, and focused on both teaching and studying.</p>

  <p>With renewed dedication, I retook the Form Two exams in <em>1967</em> and passed — earning promotion to <em>P2 teacher</em>. It was a powerful reminder: those who leave their comfort zones can harvest greater rewards.</p>

  <p>Emboldened, I registered for my <em>Form Four exams</em> through the <em>London Education Council</em>. It was no easy feat. I sat the exam four separate times — passing one paper at a time until I had all four. Persistence was my teacher. Giving up was never an option.</p>

  <p>This relentless pursuit of learning wasn’t just about titles — it was about transforming my future, my family, and ultimately, my entire community.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">🏫 Chapter Three: Working as a Teacher and Church Leader</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “To teach is to touch lives forever. To lead in faith is to plant seeds of eternal hope. In classrooms and congregations, Chief Nyanaro sowed wisdom and watered purpose. His legacy reminds us that the greatest leaders are those who serve not just with their hands, but with their hearts.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Matthew 5:14</em> — “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.”</p>

  <p>In <em>1971</em>, after finally securing all four papers in the rigorous London Council exams, I qualified for promotion to <em>P1 teacher</em>. It was a moment of joy — earned through years of hard work, sacrifice, and persistence. When the education office offered me headteacher positions, I initially declined, preferring to remain close to students. Eventually, I accepted a deputy role and later took on the full responsibility as <em>headteacher of Gekendo Primary School</em>.</p>

  <p>With passion and leadership, I spearheaded the growth of Gekendo Primary. As enrollment rose, the school expanded from two to four streams. The increased demand sparked a vision: to establish a secondary school where our students could continue learning. I led the school committee as secretary, and together we founded what would become a new <em>Gekendo Secondary School</em>.</p>

  <p>Parents began transferring their children to our school due to the academic standards we upheld. With growing numbers, we established two branch schools — one at <em>Sore</em> and another at <em>Nyanchoka</em>. I was appointed as the headteacher of Nyanchoka branch. Within just a year, under my stewardship, the school flourished, earning me a new promotion from the education office.</p>

  <p>In early <em>1972</em>, I joined the <em>Harambee committee</em> tasked with building <em>Kiabonyoru Secondary School</em>. As treasurer of the board, I ensured transparency and accountability in handling the school’s funds. During that time, the education officer, <em>Daniel Omangi</em>, transferred me to <em>Nyaramba Primary School</em>, a posting that brought me closer to home.</p>

  <p>While serving at Nyaramba, I was also appointed as the <em>secretary of the parish council</em> at <em>Kebirigo Mission</em>. I embraced the role, believing wholeheartedly that <em>service to man is service to God</em>. Balancing multiple leadership positions, I remained committed to both school and church duties — always guided by faith and a heart for community.</p>

  <p>My presence at <em>Nyaramba market</em> became a daily ritual, where I shared tea and stories with locals. Among them were my uncle, <em>Paul Ondieki</em>, and his friend <em>Wilson Gesaka</em>. One day, they informed me that the community was rallying for me to succeed <em>Chief Agustino Moturi Obwang’i</em>, who was soon to retire.</p>

  <p>I listened quietly, unsure whether it was genuine or political talk. I reminded them that I wa</p>

s simply a teacher, devoted to helping children chase their dreams and supporting the church’s mission. I had just been appointed <strong>chairperson of the parish committee to the Diocese of Kisii</strong>, serving under <strong>Bishop Mogendi</strong>. My heart was in teaching. My soul was in service.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">✈️ Chapter Four: Travel to Rome</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “Some journeys are more than just miles—they are spiritual awakenings. Chief Nyanaro’s pilgrimage to Rome was not only a journey across continents, but a deepening of faith, humility, and purpose. It showed that leadership guided by God is strengthened through sacred encounters and the courage to see beyond borders.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Psalm 121:8</em> — “The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.”</p>

  <p>Eventually, the news was confirmed — <em>Chief Agustino Moturi</em> had retired. Whispers from the community grew louder, calling for me to step into leadership. Many believed my years of grassroots development — from building schools and churches to guiding families — had prepared me for the mantle of chief. But as that conversation simmered, a new and sacred opportunity arose.</p>

  <p>In <em>1975</em>, the diocese organized a fully sponsored spiritual pilgrimage to <em>Rome, Italy</em>. During a parish council meeting, I was surprised and humbled to find my name among those selected. The church believed I was deserving — and perhaps, in their eyes and God’s, my journey of faith needed to expand beyond borders.</p>

  <p>In May of that year, we departed aboard a <em>Jumbo Jet</em>, alongside believers from across Kenya — Nyeri, Malindi, Siaya, Namanga, and more. It was an enormous aircraft filled with faith-filled hearts. We first landed in <em>France</em> (then referred to as Rhodes), where we stayed for a few days to rest and prepare.</p>

  <p>From there, our journey continued by train, taking us two days through scenic routes toward the <em>Mediterranean Sea</em>. We arrived late in the evening, the same time we had set off — a poetic cycle of departure and arrival. Crossing the sea, we finally reached <em>Vatican City</em> in Rome.</p>

  <p>The experience was unforgettable. We visited sacred sites, prayed fervently, and soaked in the spiritual atmosphere of the world's spiritual heart. It was not just sightseeing — it was a deep and holy moment of reflection and spiritual anchoring.</p>

  <p>Upon returning home, we shared our testimonies at <em>Kebirigo Mission</em> and within our zone at <em>Nyaramba</em>. The pilgrimage had rekindled something powerful within me — not just faith, but a readiness to serve beyond myself, beyond the classroom, and even beyond the church.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">💍 Chapter Five: Marriage</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “A strong marriage is the heart of every lasting legacy. In choosing love, commitment, and faith, Chief Nyanaro and his beloved Mary built a family rooted in unity and service. Their bond was not just a personal blessing, but a foundation for generations — proving that love anchored in God endures all seasons.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</em> — “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.”</p>

  <p>After our spiritual pilgrimage to Rome, my beloved wife <em>Mary Bochaberi</em> and I made the prayerful decision to solemnize our union in the church. Though we had already honored our cultural traditions through dowry, we desired to dedicate our marriage before God.</p>

  <p>Our wedding took place at <em>Nyaramba Catholic Church</em>, officiated by <em>Father Richard Queen</em>. It was a moment of deep blessing and fulfillment — one that sealed our love in faith and spiritual unity.</p>

  <p>Mary has been my unwavering companion through every chapter of life. Together, we were blessed with <em>nine incredible children</em>, each a gift and a light to our home:</p>

  <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
    <li><em>Masline Moraa</em></li>
    <li><em>Stella Mosinya</em></li>
    <li><em>Kevin Bundi</em></li>
    <li><em>Jane Kerubo</em></li>
    <li><em>Robert Kebaso</em></li>
    <li><em>Pius Chelluget</em></li>
    <li><em>Lillian Bosibori</em></li>
    <li><em>Collette Kerubo</em></li>
    <li><em>Geoffrey Samusi</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>They are not only my children but also my strength, my joy, and my legacy. Their support through every stage of my journey has been steadfast and humbling. As a family, we have held hands through both challenges and triumphs — always guided by faith and love.</p>

  <p>To Mary, my rock and lifelong partner — I thank God for you. And to our children and their families, may the Lord bless you richly and guide you daily. I could not have asked for more.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">🎖️ Chapter Six: Working as a Chief and Other Achievements</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “Leadership is not given — it is earned through trust, vision, and selfless action. Chief Nyanaro rose not for titles, but for transformation. His service as chief was marked by compassion, wisdom, and a fierce dedication to his people. True greatness, as he showed, lies in building others, one decision, one school, one road, one soul at a time.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Proverbs 11:14</em> — “Where there is no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.”</p>

  <p>It was eventually confirmed — the position of <em>Chief</em> had officially been announced. What was once rumor became reality, and I felt called to serve. I submitted my application, and by God's grace, I was appointed and officially sworn in on <em>26th February 1976</em>. My posting was at <em>Ekerenyo</em>, and I embraced the title “Chief” with great pride and responsibility.</p>

  <p>The swearing-in was a grand occasion. <em>Isaiah Chelluget</em>, the Nyanza Provincial Commissioner, officiated the ceremony alongside the District Commissioners of Kisii and Nyamira — <em>John Otika</em> among them. Religious leaders prayed over me as the ceremonial chief’s hat was placed on my head. <em>Father Richard Queen</em> and <em>Pastor Stephenson Maturi</em> were among the spiritual leaders present. Also attending were our MP, <em>Livingstone Ateba Mariita</em>, and local counselor, <em>Raphael Ondieki</em>.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, I committed myself to meaningful service. I helped spearhead the construction and expansion of <em>schools</em>, <em>churches</em>, <em>roads</em>, <em>polytechnics</em>, and <em>health facilities</em>. The people had placed their trust in me, and I worked diligently to fulfill their hopes.</p>

  <p>I knew those earlier eclipses in my life were not just coincidence — they were signs of a divine path toward leadership. And through that divine guidance, I witnessed the birth of many developments: new schools, hospitals, and sustainable farming initiatives that ensured food security in every household.</p>

  <p>My love for education remained strong. I chaired many <em>school boards</em> and contributed extensively to academic growth. Later, I was honored to serve as <em>Chairperson of the Land Control Board</em> in Ekerenyo, where we trained farmers on soil conservation and improved farming practices. Crops like <em>maize, beans, coffee, and tea</em> flourished, and livestock keeping improved family livelihoods.</p>

  <p>My leadership journey continued as I rose to the position of <em>Senior Chief</em>, and eventually, <em>Paramount Chief</em> — overseeing all chiefs in the region. I underwent several training programs in <em>Embu</em>, <em>Matuga</em>, and <em>Embaasi</em> (Nairobi) to enhance my administrative and governance skills.</p>

  <p>Together with fellow leaders, we founded the <em>Gusii Cultural Council</em> — a body of elders entrusted with guiding cultural, social, and political matters within the community. Our work shaped the identity and governance of our people for generations to come.</p>

  <p>Among other projects, I helped establish:
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>New <em>primary and secondary schools</em></li>
      <li>Several <em>youth polytechnics</em></li>
      <li>The <em>D.O.’s office</em> in Ekerenyo and <em>housing for police officers</em></li>
      <li><em>Ekerenyo Health Centre</em>, now a major hospital</li>
      <li><em>Itibo Flower Society</em>, supporting local flower farmers</li>
      <li><em>Ekerubo Gietai Youth Institute</em> and <em>location offices</em> for current administrators</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>To this day, I remain deeply proud of the work accomplished — and even more so, of my son <em>Pius</em>, who now serves in these very offices we once built. May the legacy of service, faith, and community never be forgotten.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2e3a59;">🌅 Chapter Seven: Retirement</h3>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2e3a59; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    “Retirement is not the end of service — it is the beginning of reflection, mentorship, and legacy. Chief Nyanaro did not step away from duty; he stepped deeper into purpose, guiding others with wisdom hard-earned and freely shared. In rest, he still built. In quiet, he still led. True leaders never truly retire — they continue to inspire.”
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>2 Timothy 4:7</em> — “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.”</p>

  <p>Though I eventually stepped down from my formal duties, the call to serve never truly faded. Retirement was not an end, but a gentle transition — from public office to quiet mentorship and continued contribution to community growth.</p>

  <p>I remained involved in various projects, particularly in <em>water access and school development</em>. Wherever I was called upon, I offered my support willingly. It gave me joy to continue helping others, even without title or office.</p>

  <p>The work I had done as <em>Paramount Chief</em> was recognized not only by the people but also by the government. At one point, I received an <em>honorary recognition award from the President</em> for exemplary service. Alongside the award came a generous monetary gift, which proved to be a blessing for my family.</p>

  <p>That financial support enabled us to fund our <em>youngest daughter’s journey to the United States</em> for further education — a dream come true. It also allowed me to assist in the education of some of my grandchildren, whose parents were facing financial hardships. Thanks to that support, they were able to pursue their studies, fulfill their ambitions, and now sustain themselves and their families.</p>

  <p>My greatest hope for them is that they, too, will carry forward the spirit of service. That they will reach out and support others in need — just as they once received help. In doing so, they will not only honor our family legacy but also bless countless others.</p>

  <p>Even in retirement, I have remained guided by purpose — continuing to lead, love, and lift others, one act of kindness at a time.</p>

  <p><em>“To my beloved people, friends, leaders, church family, and generations to come…”</em></p>

  <p>I served you with all my strength because I believed leadership is a calling to build others, not oneself. Together, we built schools, hospitals, churches, roads, and strong families. Together, we dreamed, we worked, and we grew.</p>
  <p>I want to remind you, especially the young people, that greatness is born from humility, hard work, faith, and respect. Never give up on your dreams — I am living proof that a humble beginning does not determine the size of your destiny.</p>
  <p>To my fellow leaders, lead with justice, honesty, and fear of God. To the church and elders, remain our pillars of wisdom. To my dear community, stay united in love and purpose.</p>
  <p>I bless you all and thank you. May God bless North Mugirango and our beloved Kenya!</p>
